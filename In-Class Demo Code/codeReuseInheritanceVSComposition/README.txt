This folder has two subfolders with java code illustrating aspects
of code reuse.  

1. In the inheritance folder there are two items:

   1. The file InstrumentedHashSet.java has code from Bloch 
      Item 16: favor composition over inheritance. The code shows
      how inheritance combined with override breaks encapsulation.

   2. The files: Point.java, PointC.java, WeightedPoint.java and
      WeightedPointC.java illustrate the OO approach to code reuse.
    
2. In the composition folder the file WeightedPointC.java shows how
   to achieve code reuse using composition.
